## What is machine learning?

"Programming computers to learn from experience" - Arthur Samuel (1959)

**Eliza**: illusion of understanding language by **pattern-matching** and generating **pre-programmed** responses. Not machine learning.

## What is AI?

"AI refers broadly to techniques that enable machines to solve problems once considered solvable only by humans..."

"machine learning being its key sub-field focusing on creating algorithms learning from collections of examples".

Blurred Distinction: **Artificial General Intelligence** is no here - yet?

The "singularity" - technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreresible, unpredictable, self-improving.
