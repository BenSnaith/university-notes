## Natural Language Processing

**Natural Language Processing** is a field of science and engineering dedicated to the study and development of automatic systems that are capable of *understanding* and *generating* natural human language.

## NLP and ML

## Sub-fields of NLP

- **Natural Language Understanding**
- **Natural Language Generation**

## Common Terminology

 - **Corpus** - A large collection of texts used for training NLP models. For example, a corpus might consist of a vast set of news articles (also called a Dataset).
 - **Documents** - Individual pieces of text within a corpus. For instance.
 - **Vocabulary** - The set of unique words in a corpus. For instance, the vocabulary might include words like "economy", "politics" and "innovation".
 - **Words** - The basic units of language, such as "economy", "politics", and "innovation".
 - **Token** - A unit of text that a language model processes, such as "economy", "!", "123".

## Applications of NLP

 - **Text-Centric Processing applications**
 - **Interactive & Multi-Modal Systems applications**

## Representing words

 - In language, a **signifier** is a word and the signified is the actual thing or idea that it represents
 - **Sentence**: "Luna feeds the cat of her brother"
	 - **Signifiers**:
		 - "Luna" refers to a specific person (Luna)
		 - "cat" refers to the animal (cat)
		 - "brother" refers to a specific person (her bother)
	 - **Signified**:
		 - Luna is feeding a particular cat that belongs to her brother.
	 - **Specificity**:
		 - "The cat" refers to one specific cat, not cats in general.
		 - "Her brother" refers to a specific person, not brothers in general.
	 - **Relationships**:
		 - The sentence shows a relationship between Luna, her brother, and the cat.
	 - **Comparison**:
		 - If we say, "Luna feeds cats", the meaning changes
			 - "Cats" now refers to cats in general, not a specific cat
			 - The relationship to her bother is no longer part of the sentence.
		- If we say, "Luna feeds the dog", the meaning also changes
			- "Dog" now refers to a specific dog, not all cats.

## NLP: Word-to-Vector Conversion

- Words like "cat" and "dog" are related because they both represent animals.

## NLP Challenges

 - NLP is **difficult** because human language is complicated, confusing, and ever-changing.
 - We rely on a lot of contextual information as humans
	 - **Implicit references**:
		 - The trees were swaying wildly outside Anne's window as she prepared for bed, and the gutters were overflowing -> **It was a dark and stormy night**
	- **Ambiguous References / Semantics**:
		- "Call me a taxi please." -> **Their name is now a Taxi? Or they need to get a Taxi?**
	- **Imprecise rules**:
		- Work -> **Worked**
		- Teach -> **Taught**
	- **Great variety of languages**
	- **Slang Words**:
		- syfm
		- sybau
