## Motivation for AI
###### AI is revolutionising industries such as automotive, healthcare, finance, and IT. Key transformations include:
- **Automotive and Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles and route optimisation
- **Healthcare**: Diagnostics, personalised medicine, and robotic surgeries
- **Finance**: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading
- **Services**: Enhancing operations in insurance, law, HR, and media with AI-powered tools like chatbots and automated analysis
- **IT Sector**: Driving innovations in search engines, speech recognition, machine translation, and recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)

## What is Artificial Intelligence?
- "AI Involves designing systems capable of human-like intelligence: perception, reasoning, choice, learning, communication, and collaboration" - Concise Oxford Dictionary
- "AI is about creating intelligent machines and understanding human intelligence through computation. AI can use methods beyond biologically observable mechanisms" - John McCarthy
- "Emphasized developing machines capable of tasks requiring intelligence if done by humans" - Marvin Minsky
- "Explored mental faculties through computational models and intelligent system creation" - Eugene Charniak and John L. Gordon

### Core categories of AI Systems:
1. Systems that think like humans
2. Systems that think rationally
3. Systems that act like humans
4. Systems that act rationally

## Four Categories of AI
### 1. Thinking Humanly
- Focuses on mimicking human cognitive processes.
- Requires understanding human though processes via introspection or psychological experiments
- E.g. The **General Problem Solver (1956)** demonstrated solving problems by emulating human steps and time.

### 2. Thinking Rationally
- Implements "right thinking" using formal logic and reasoning principles
- **Originates from Aristotle's logic**, later formalised in the 19th century.
- Applications: Logical reasoning in AI enables structured problem-solving, e.g. deducing facts from premises like "All computers generate heat"

### 3. Acting Humanly
- The **Turing Test** evaluates machine intelligence. A computer passes if it fools an interrogator into believing its human.
- Required Capabilities:
	- Natural Language Processing (understanding and generating language)
	- Knowledge representation
	- Automated reasoning
	- Machine learning
- E.g. Crafting questions to test a machine's ability to think and respond like a human.

### 4. Acting Rationally
- Aims for rational agents that maximize goal achievement based on available information.
- Rationality is about achieving the best outcome or expected outcome when uncertainty exists
- E.g. Self-driving cars making decisions in dynamic environments.

## Artificial Intelligence vs Human Intelligence
### Comparison of Capabilities:
- **Execution of Speed**: AI is much faster
- **Emotions**: AI lacks emotions, unlike humans
- **Imagination**: Humans excel at creativity; AI is limited to its programming
- **Flexibility**: Humans are adaptable; AI remains rigid within its scope
- **Computation**: AI processes large-scale computations effortlessly

## The Foundations of AI
### 1. Philosophy:
- Origin of the idea of the mind as a machine
- Philosophical inquiries about reasoning and the nature of intelligence
### 2. Mathematics:
- Provides tools for representation (logic, probability, and algorithms)
- Probability theory aids in handling uncertainty; decision theory combines probability and utility
### 3. Psychology:
- Studies human reasoning and behaviour to inform AI models
### 4. Neuroscience:
- Exploits the physical basis of mental activity, inspiring neural networks
### 5. Linguistics:
- Enables natural language understanding through syntax, semantic, and representation
### 6. Computer Engineering
- Advances in hardware and software enable scalable AI applications
### 7. Control Theory:
- Guides optimal design of stable systems (e.g., robotic controls)

## A brief History of AI
### 1940s-1950s: Early Days
- **1943**: McCulloch and Pitts propose a Boolean circuit model of the brain
- **1950**: Alan Turing's seminal paper on computing and intelligence
### 1950s-1970s: Birth of AI
- **1956**: Dartmouth Conference formalises AI as a field.
- **1965**: Development of algorithms for logical reasoning
### 1970s-1990s: Knowledge Based Systems
- Expert systems flourish, then decline during the "AI Winter"
### 1990-2012: Statistical Approaches
- Focus shifts to probabilistic methods and machine learning
### 2012-Present: Big Data and Neural Networks
- AI Resurgence fuelled by advancements in data availability and computational power.
- Achievements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and industry-wide AI integration.

## Major AI Technologies
### 1. Machine Learning (ML):
- Arthur Samuel (1959): ML enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming
- E.g. AlphaGo uses reinforcement learning to master the game of Go

### 2. Neural Networks and Deep Learning:
- Mimic brain structures to identify data patterns.
- Deep learning involves multiple hidden layers for complex feature extraction

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Involves tasks like machine translation, chatbots, and speech-to-text systems.
- E.g. Google Translate and Conversation AI systems like Siri

### 4. Robotics:
- Robots handle dangerous, repetitive or precision tasks.
- E.g. Medical robots (e.g. Da Vinci Surgical Robot) and household robots

### 5. Computer Vision:
- Enables object recognition, scene segmentation, and image classification
- Applications: Facial recognition systems and autonomous vehicles.

### 6. Generative AI:
- Produces new content (e.g. images, text, or music)
- Applications: Deepfake creation, synthetic media generation

## Limitations of AI
1. **Lack of Creativity**: AI relies on existing data and patterns
2. **Bias**: Flawed training data can lead to biased outcomes
3. **Understanding**: Limited comprehension of abstract concepts
4. **Dependence on Data**: Requires high-quality data for optimal performance
5. **Ethical Concerns**: Risks related to privacy, surveillance and decision-making
6. **High Costs**: Development and deployment can be resource-intense
7. **Job Displacement**: Automation replaces certain human roles.
