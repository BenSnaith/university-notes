## What is Artificial Intelligence?

- AI is the part of computer science concerned with design of computer systems that exhibit human intelligence.
- We associate intelligence with the ability to; Perceive, Reason, Choose, Act, Achieve Goals, Learn, Reflect, Communicate, Collaborate, Organise.

## Four Categories of AI

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Thinking Humanly**  <br>  <br>”The exciting new effort to make computers think… machines with minds, in the full and literal sense.”  <br>  <br>”[The automation of] activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as decision making, problem solving, learning…|**Thinking Rationally**  <br>  <br>”The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models.”  <br>  <br>”The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act.|
|**Acting Humanly  <br>  <br>**  <br>”The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people”  <br>  <br>”The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people do better.”|**Acting Rationally**  <br>  <br>”Computational Intelligence is the study of the design of intelligent agents.”  <br>  <br>”AI… is concerned with intelligent behaviour in artifacts.”|

## Thinking Humanly

- To build a machine that thinks like a human
- A cognitive modelling approach
- First, we need to know how we think, e.g.
    - Through introspection (thinking about how we do it — unscientific)
    - Through psychological experiments (proper science)
- Once we have sufficient information about the working of minds it becomes easy to implement it as a computer program.
- If the computer’s input-output behaviour matches the corresponding human behaviour than it would be the evidence that some of the program’s mechanism could also be working operating in humans.

Example:

- The General Problem Solver
    - One of the first attempts at AI was in 1956.
    - This program was designed to solve any problem that could be presented in the form of mathematical formulas.
    - The developers were not so much interested in whether or not GPS (General Problem Solver) solved problems correctly. They were more interested in showing that it solved problems like people, going through the same steps and taking around the same amount of time to perform those steps.

## Thinking Rationally

- How to build machines that represent “right thinking” to create intelligent machines.
- This “right thinking” is defined in coding using logic or laws of thought.
- Borrows from Aristotle’s right thinking - Greek Philosopher
- **Example**: _All computers use energy. Using energy always generated heat. Therefore, all computers generate heat._
- Formal logic was developed in the late nineteenth century.
    - Precise notation to describe reasoning which gives us the tools to solve any logical problem.
- This was the first step toward enabling computer programs to reason logically.

## Acting Humanly

- The first proposal for success in building a program and acts humanly was the **Turing Test.**
- Alan Turing (Turing, 1950) famous British mathematician.
- Proposed an operational test for intelligent behaviour: The Imitation Game.
- Turing Test: A computer passes the test of intelligence, if it can fool a human interrogator.
- To be considered intelligent, a program must be able to act sufficiently like a human to fool a human interrogator.
- A human interrogates the program and another human via a terminal simultaneously.
- To convince the interrogator of its intelligence, the computer must:
    - Understand and generate language.
    - Know about the world.
    - Reason about the world.
    - Learn about the dialogue.
    - Combine all of this knowledge and reasoning instantaneously.

## Acting Rationally

- How to create AI systems that act in a way which maximises its chance of achieving its goal, given the available information.
- To act rationally means:
    - To acts so as to achieve one’s goals, given one’s beliefs
- A rational agent is one that perceives its environment and acts so as to achieve the best outcome or when there is uncertainly, the best expected outcome.
- Doesn’t necessarily involve thinking — e.g. blinking reflex — but thinking should be in the service of rational action.
- AI can be viewed as the study and construction of rational agents.
- Self driving cards are examples of AI systems that act rationally (rational agents)
- Achieving perfect rationality in complex environments is not possible because the computational demands are too high.

## The Foundation of AI

![[image 1.png]]

- Philosophy
    - At that time, the study of human intelligence began with no formal expression.
    - Initiate the idea of mind as a machine and its internal operations.
- Mathematics
    - Formal representation and proof, algorithms, computation, decidability, tractability, probability.
    - Probability contributes to the “degree of belief” to handle uncertainty in AI
    - Decision theory combines probability theory and utility theory (bias)
- Psychology
    - How do humans think and act?
    - They study of human reasoning and acting.
    - Provides reasoning models for AI.
    - Strengthen the ideas.
- Linguistics
    - For understanding natural languages
    - Formal languages
    - Syntactic and semantic analysis
    - Knowledge representation
- Neuroscience
    - Physical substrate for mental activity.
- Control Theory
    - Stability, simple optimal agent designs, homeostatic systems.
- Computer Engineering
    - How to build an efficient computer?
    - Provides the artifact that makes AI application possible.
    - The power of computers makes computation of large and difficult problems more easily.
    - AI has also contributed its own work to computer science, including: time-sharing, linked-lists, OOP, etc.

## Machine Learning

- Arthur Samuel, 1959
    - A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Is it different from Traditional Programming

## Example: AlphaGo

- AlphaGo is the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player, a landmark achievement that experts believe was a decade ahead of its time.
- Trained on thousands of professional games to learn how to play Go.
- AlphaGo Zero skips this step and leans to play simply by playing games against itself making completely random moves.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

![[image 4.png]]

- A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavours to recognise underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.
- Deep learning: means using a neural network with a series of hidden layers of non-linear operations between input and output.
- Why now? Lot of data and more computational power!

## Generative AI

- Learns the underlying set of data and generates new data closely mimics the original data.
- Are mainly used to create new content, such as images, text, or even music which looks exactly the same as what might be created by humans.
