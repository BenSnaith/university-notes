### Intelligence

"Intelligence is how we think, perceive, understand, predict and manipulate a world far larger and more complicated than itself."

### What is AI?

These are the agreed upon eight definitions for AI, the definition in which you use depends somewhat on the philosophy that you want the AI to follow, should it be and act more human or should be be and act more rationally?

### Acting Humanly: The Turing Test Approach

The _Turing Test_ proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed to provide a satisfactory operational definition to intelligence, i.e. Pass this test and you are a human, or you act humanly enough __(Any large language model today will easily pass this text, oh no! we're doomed)__

A quick tick list of what you would need to pass this test would be as follows 

- [ ] __Natural Language Processing__: to enable it to communicate successfully in English.
- [ ] __Knowledge Representation__: To stoke what it knows or hears.
- [ ] __Automated Reasoning__: To use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions.
- [ ] __Machine Learning__: To adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

The _Turing Test_ deliberately avoids direct physical contact between the interrogator and the computer, because a computer doesn't look like a person (yet...) However the _Total Turing Test_ includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the computers perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to "pass" things to the computer.

To pass the total Turing Test, the computer will need.

- [ ] __Computer Vision__: To perceive objects.
- [ ] __Robotics__: To manipulate objects and move about.

These six requirements compose most of AI, and Turing deserves credit for creating a test in the 1950s which can still be applied 75 years later!

### Thinking Humanly

If we want to say that a program thinks like a human, we first need to determine what it is like to think like a human, as a human! There are __three__ ways to do this.

1. __Introspection__: Trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by.
2. __Psychological Experiments__: Observing a person in action.
3. __Brain Imaging__: Observing the brain in action.

Once we have a clear idea of what it means to think humanly we can determine if the program can think humanly. If the programs Input / Output behaviour matches corresponding human behaviour, that is evidence that the program to some extent, acts humanly.

__Allen Newell__ and __Herbert Simon__ developed the __General Problem Solver__, were not content merely to have their program solve problems correctly, there were more concerned with comparing the trace of its reasoning and tracing the steps on how it got to the answer, similar to how a human would reason the problem.

### Thinking Rationally

Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify (classify) "right thinking" that is, an irrefutable reasoning process, providing patterns and reasoning that always provide a correct premises, e.g.

"Socrates is a man; all men are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal"

These laws of thought initialise the field named __Logic__.

Logicians in the 19th century developed a precise notation for statements about all kinds of objects in the world at the relationships between them.

There are __two__ main obstacles to this approach, First, it is not easy to take informal knowledge and state it in formal terms required by the logical notation. Secondly, there is a big difference between solving a problem "in principle" and solving it in practice

### Acting Rationally

An __Agent__ is simply something that acts. Of course all computer programs so _something_, but computer agents are expected to do more: operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persis over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals.

A __Rational Agent__ is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, where there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

In the _"laws of thought"_ approach to AI, the emphasis was on correct inferences, Making correct inferences is part of being a rational agent, because one way to act rationally is to reason logically to the conclusion that a given action will achieve one's goals and then act on that conclusion.

There are also ways of acting rationally that cannot be said to involve inference. For example, recoiling from a hot stove is a reflex action and is usually more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation.

The rational agent approach has __two__ advantages over the other approaches, First it is more general than they "laws of thought" approach because correct inference is just one of several possible mechanism of achieving rationality. Second it is more amendable to scientific development than are approached based on human behaviour or human thought.

The standard for rationality is mathematically well defined and completely general, and can be "unpacked" to generate agent designs that provably achieve the determined goals.

__Human Behaviour__ on the other hand is more adapted to one specific environment.
