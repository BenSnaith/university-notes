### Sorting

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
	bool isAnagram(std::string s, std::string t)
	{
		if(s.length() != t.length())
		{
			return false;
		}

		sort(s.begin(), s.end());
		sort(t.begin(), t.end());
		return s == t;
	}
}
```

We sort both of the string and then compare them too see if they are the same.

__Time Complexity: O(nlogn + mlogm)__

The addition of the time complexities of the sorting algorithms added together.

__Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n + m)__

Depending on the sorting algorithm. (where n is the length of string s and m is the length of string t).

### Hash Table

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
	bool isAnagram(std::string s, std::string t)
	{
		if(s.length() != t.length())
		{
			return false;
		}

		std::unordered_map<char, int> countS;
		std::unordered_map<char, int> countT;
		for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
		{
			countS[s[i]]++;
			countT[t[i]]++;
		}
		return countS == countT;
	}
}
```

Create two HashMaps, one for String S and one for String T, we then iterate through each character in the String and add them to the relevant index relating to the ASCII value of the character.

__Time Complexity: O(n + m)__

Where n is the length of string s and m is the length of string t. 

__Space Complexity: O(1)__

Since we have at most 26 different characters and constants reduce down to O(1).

### Hash Table (Optimal)

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
	bool isAnagram(std::string s, std::string t)
	{
		if(s.length() != t.length())
		{
			return false;
		}

		std::vector<int> count(26, 0);
		for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
		{
			count[s[i] - 'a']++;
			count[t[i] - 'a']--;
		}

		for(int val : count)
		{
			if(val != 0) return false;
		}
		return true;
	}
}
```

Here we maintain one HashSet of each characters ASCII value to the amount of occurrences however in this case, we go through string s and add at the specific indexes and then go through t and remove from the present indexes, doing so every value should be 0, if we find anything different there then the strings are different.

__Time Complexity: O(n + m)__

Where n is the length of string s and m is the length of string t.

__Space Complexity: O(1)__

Since we have at most 26 different characters, and therefore the constant reduces down to O(1).
