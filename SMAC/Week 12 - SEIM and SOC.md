### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems

 - Combining security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM), security information and event management (SIEM) offers real-time monitoring and analysis of events as well as tracking and logging of security data for compliance or auditing purposes.
 - Provide a centralised, uniform audit trail storage facility and a suite of audit data analysis programs.

### SIEM Configuration

There are two general configuration approaches:

 - Agentless.
	 - The SIEM server receives data from individual log generating hosts without needing to have any special software installed on those hosts.
 - Agent-based.
	 - An agent program is installed on the log generating host
