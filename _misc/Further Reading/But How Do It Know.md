## Speed.

Computers are simple, they do simple things, one at a time, however they can do these things extremely quickly.

The secret to a computers computational power is not intelligence but speed.

Computers use electricity and electricity in a wire can travel around half the speed of light.

Some of the component in a computer are closer than others, and the closer the shorter the electricity has to travel, and therefore the quicker.

## Just a little bit.

Computers work using electricity, and this electricity can either be off or on.

## Simple Variations

A gate is the only thing you need when you build a computer.

This is the diagram for a NOT gate with A and B representing the same wire

Since, A and B are the same, they could just be classified as one input

This is the combination of a NAND gate and a NOT gate in tandem

This unit is used so often, that it is built into a single unit, it is simpler to understand as an AND gate

We cane remove the X as it is no loner needed.
