Figure 1.2; A simplified view of hardware and software as heirarchical layers, shown as concetric circles with hardware in the center and application software outermost.

There are many types of systems software, but two types of systems software are central to every computer system today; an operating system and a compiler. An operating system interfaces between a userâ€™s program and the hardware porides a variety of servies and supervisory functions, it handles:

- Handling basic input and output operations.
- Allocating storage and memory.
- Providing for protected sharing of the computer amoung multiple applications using it simultaneously.

  

Compilers translate a program written in a high level language such as C++ or Java into instructions which the computer can understand, this translation is very complex.

  

### From a High-Level Language to the Language of Hardware.

To speak to electronic hardware, you need to send it electrical signals, the easiest signals for a computer to understand are off and on. The computer alphabet is 1, 0 but much like how ours is only 26 letters, it does not limit what we can say.

An **Assembler** translaters a symbolic version of an instruction to binary.
