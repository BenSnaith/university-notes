OK Computer.

Harvard CS50 is about problem solving.

Start early in the week when doing your code, you are gonna hit a wall.

Scratch was created at MIT. did not know lol.

## What is computer science?

computer science is not just programming, it’s the study of information, how to interpret and process, and how to solve problems.

Input > SecretSolution > Output

  

Unary = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = Base-1

Decimal = 1, 2, 3, 5, 15, 500 = Base-10, 10^1, 2, 3

Binary = 1, 0 = Base-2, 2^0, 2^1, 2^2

  

## What is a bit?

A bit is a zero or a one, represented physically through the presence or absence of electricity.

The computer contains millions of transistors that can either be flipped on or off.

000 - 111.

  

## Bytes

Eight bits.

0000 0000

1111 1111 = 255

ASCII (uses 7 bits)

![[Untitled 2.png|Untitled 2.png]]

A = 65 = 01000001

B = 66 = 01000010

etc.

Unicode

UTF = Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits - 1 byte

RGB = 3 bytes

## Abstraction

The simplification of something so you focus on the high level goals and not the low level implementation.

You don’t know how a car works you just use it.

## Pseudocode.

1 ==Pick up== phone book  
2  
==Open to== middle  
3  
==Look at== page  
4  
==If== ==person is on page==  
5  
==call== person  
6  
==Else if== ==person is earlier in book==  
7  
==open to== the middle of the left of the phone book  
8 go back to line 3  
9  
==Else if== ==person is later in book==  
10  
==open to== middle of right half of book  
11 go back to line 3  
12  
==Else==  
13 Quit
