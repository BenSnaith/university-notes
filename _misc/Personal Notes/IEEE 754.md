IEEE 754 is a technical standard for floating point arithmetic established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) which addresses many problems found in diverse floating-point implementations.

### Sizes;

16-bit: Half = 0.000061 - 65504  
32-bit: Single = too big  
64-bit: Double  
128-bit: Quadruple  
256-bit: Octuple  
There are other extended precisions.
