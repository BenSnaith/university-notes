- **Firmware**

Provides the low-level control for a device’s specific hardware, such as the BIOS, it’s non-volatile and contained on ROM, EPROM, EEPROM or Flash

- **Chipset**

A chipset is a set of electronic components on one or more ULSI integrated circuits known as “Data Flow Management System”

In computing, the term chipset commonly refers to a set of specialized chips on a computer’s motherboard or an expansion card (northbridge / southbridge).

- **Write buffer**

Is a type of data buffer that can be used to hold data being written from the cache to main memory or to the next cache in the memory hierarchy to improve performance and reduce latency.

Use of a write buffer in this manner frees the cache to service read requests while the write is taking place. It is especially useful for very slow main memory in that subsequent reads are able to proceed without waiting for long main memory latency. when the write buffer is full, subsequent writes still have to wait until slots are freed.
