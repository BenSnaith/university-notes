Computer architecture is a description of the structure of a computer system made from component parts. It can sometimes be a high-level description that ignores details of the implementation. At a more detailed level, the description may include the instruction set, architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design and implementation.

Von Neumann

The Von Neumann architecture — also known as the Von Neumann model or Princeton architecture — is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John Von Neumann and by others. The document described a design architecture for a digital computer with these components;

- A processing unit with both an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
- A control unit that includes an instruction register and a program counter.
- Memory that stores data and instructions
- External mass storage
- Input and output mechanisms

The term “Von Neumann architecture” has evolved to refer to any stored program compute in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time (since they share a common bus). This is referred to as the Von Neumann bottleneck, which often limits the performance of the corresponding system.

The design of a Von Neumann architecture machine is simpler than in a Harvard architecture machine — which is also a stored-program system, yet has one dedicated set of address and data buses for reading a writing to memory, and another set of address and data buses to fetch instructions.

A stored program computer uses the same underlying mechanism to encode both program instructions and data as opposed to designs which use a mechanism such as discrete plugboard wiring or fixed control circuitry for instruction implementation. Stored-program computers were an advancement over the manually reconfigured or fixed function computers of the 1940s, such as the Colossus and the ENIAC. These were programmed by setting switches and inserting patch cables to route data and control signals between various functional units.
