A form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. a RAM device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of the data inside.

In todayâ€™s technology, RAM takes the form of IC chips with MOS memory cells. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory where stored information is lost if power is removed. There are two main types of volatile random-access semiconductor memory and static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM)

  

**What is the difference between DRAM and SRAM**

  

DRAM must be continuously refreshed whereas SRAM does not, this means better power efficiency and performance.

  

**Mode of Storage**

  

While most DRAM memory cell designs use a capacitor and transistor, some only use two transistors, In the designs where a capacitor is used, the capacitor can either be charged or discharged, these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 1 and 0. The electric charge of the capacitors gradually leaks away; without intervention the data on the capacitor would soon be lost. To prevent this DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge. This refresh process is a defining feature of DRAM, in contrast to SRAM which does not require refresh. DRAM is volatile and loses data when power is removed (due to the capacitors losing everything)
