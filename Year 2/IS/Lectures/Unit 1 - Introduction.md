### Unit Overview

- Module aims, structure, assessment and feedback.
- Information Security definition and goals.
- Key Concepts and Terminology

### What is Information Security?

- Information Security is the protection of information systems in order to preserve the _confidentiality_, _availability_ and _integrity_ of their _assets_:
	- __Hardware__
	- __Software__
	- __Data__

### Key Security Goals: Confidentiality

- Only __authorised people or systems__ must be able to __access__ protected assets (e.g. data or software).
- But: it is not always easy to define who is authorised to perform what operation on which data.

_This is a bit peak._

### Key Security Goals: Availability

- Assets such as data and services must be accessible to __authorised parties__ at the __appropriate times__.
- There are numerous characteristics associated with availability; a data item or service is deemed available if;
	- It is present is a usable form.
	- It is making clear progress.
	- It completes in a acceptable period of time.
	- Requests are handled timely and fairly.
	- It can be used easily and in the way that it was indented to be used.
	- etc.

### Key Security Goals: Integrity

- Combination of several desirable properties - assets must be:
	- __Precise__
	- __Accurate__
	- __Unmodified__
	- __Consistent__
	- __Meaningful__
	- __Usable__

### Vulnerabilities, threats and controls

A _Vulnerability_ is a weakness in the information system (e.g. in its design, implementation or procedures) that can be exploited to cause loss or harm.

A _threat_ is a set of circumstances that has the potential to cause loss or harm, often through exploiting a vulnerability.

A _control_ is a protective measure (e.g., an action, device, procedure or technique) that removes or reduces a vulnerability.

A _threat_ is blocked by the _control_ of a _vulnerability_.

### Classes of Vulnerabilities

- __Interception__ - Unauthorised part has gained access to an asset.
	- e.g. Wiretapping to obtain data in a network or copying data.
- __Interruption__ - An asset becomes lost, unusable or unavailable
	- e.g. Malicious destruction or deletion.
- __Modification__ - Unauthorised part tampers with an assert
	- e.g. Changing database entries or altering of software.
- __Fabrication__ - Unauthorised part creates a counterfeit asset.
	- e.g. Inserting database entries or network transactions.

### Hardware Vulnerabilities

### Software Vulnerabilities

### Data Vulnerabilities

### Controls

- __Encryption__: Scramble data so that interpretation is meaningless for an intruder without knowledge of how the scrambling was done.
- __Software Control__: Programs must enforce security restriction, e.g., check users passwords and access rights.
- __Hardware Control__: Locks, Intrusion detection system, hardware implementations of encryption
- __Policies and procedures__: regular password changes, rules for accessing sensitive data.

### Principle of Control Effectiveness

- Control must be used - and used properly - to be effective.
- Controls must be efficient (enough), easy to use, and appropriate

### Characteristic of Information Security

- Assets are small, portable and can be very valuable.
	- Unreleased Pixar film worth millions of dollars fits on a DVD.
- No physical contact is required.
	- Attacker can easily be located in a different continent.
- Security breaches are often hard to detect.
	- Compromised computer systems may continue to be used.

### The 'Three Golden Rules' of Computer Security

- Do not own a computer.
- Do not turn it on.
- and do not use it.
