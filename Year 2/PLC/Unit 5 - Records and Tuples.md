### Unit Outcomes

Here you will learn

- How records and tuples (i.e. simple composite values) are represented, constructed, examined and modified in different PLs
- How to define types whose values are records or tuples, i.e. record types, tuple types, and union types.
- How some features of these types can be simulated in PLs that do not support them.

### Composite values and types

- A structure holding components together.

- A structure holding components together.
- Types of compositve values:
	- Record types
	- Union types
	- Collections (arrays, lists, maps)
	- Recursive types (trees, graphs)
