### Introduction

- What do we mean by __human-computer interaction__, __usability__, and __user interfaces__?
- '__Human-Computer Interaction__ is the discipline concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing system for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them'
- __User Interface__ often shortened to __UI__ - refers to the user interface artefact (i.e. the thing that the users interact with the engage the functionality of a software system)
- __Usability__ is the goal of HCI practitioners - for a UI to be usable it has to be appropriate for the users and for the users tasks
	- Don't mistake with __user friendly__ which is an ill-used term.
		- Users do not want to be friends with the program
		- "friendly" is a binary concept and usability is a lot more complex that that!

### What influences UI success

Success of a UI is usually determined by a board range of issues:

- Type of user
- Type of task
- Hardware Constraints
- Social and Cultural Limitation

The above factors + user interface = user experience
