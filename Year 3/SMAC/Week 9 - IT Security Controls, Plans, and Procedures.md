### Security Control

Controls is defined as; "An action, device, procedure, or other measure that reduces risk by eliminating or preventing a security violation, by minimising the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it to enable corrective action".

### Control Classifications

 - Management Controls
	 - Focus on security policies, planning, guidelines, and standards that influence the selection of operational and technical controls to reduce the risk of loss and to protect the organisation's mission.
	 - These controls refer to issues that management needs to address.
 - Operational Controls:
	 - Address the correct implementation and use of security policies and standards, ensuring consistency in security operations and correcting identified operational deficiencies.
	 - There controls relate to mechanisms and procedures that are primarily implemented by people rather than systems.
	 - They are used to improve the security of a system or group of systems.
 - Technical Controls:
	 - Involve the correct use of hardware and software security capabilities in systems.
	 - These range from simple to complex measures that work together to secure critical and sensitive data, information, and IT systems functions.

### Control Classes

Each of the control classes may include the following:

 - Supportive Controls:
	 - Pervasive, generic, underlying technical IT security capabilities taht are interrelate with, and used by, many other controls.
 - Preventative Controls:
	 - Focus on preventing, security breaches from occurring, by inhibiting attempts to violate security policies or exploit a vulnerability.
 - Detection and Recovery Controls:
	 - Focus on the response to a security breach, by warning of violations or attempted violations of security policies or the identified exploit of a vulnerability and by providing means to restore the resulting lost computing resources.
