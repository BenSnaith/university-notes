### Multiprocessing vs. Multiprogramming

- **Multiprocessing**
	- The use of two or more CPUs within a single computer system. It also refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor and/or the ability to allocate tasks between them.
- **Multiprogramming**
	- Multiple processes share common resources, e.g., a CPU. In a single CPU computer, only one process is running at any time. Multiprogramming solves the problem by scheduling the CPU from one process to another (context switch). When context switches occur frequently enough the illusion of parallelism is achieved. Even on multiprocessor computers, multiprogramming allows
